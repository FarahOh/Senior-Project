# Senior-Project
##Group Members: 
Zachery, Kyle, Farah, Mohini 
##Purpose: 
We choose a project in which we will carryout the duration of the semester. 
##Project: 
Basically, we are creating a mobile app, "Student Engagement App," that is cross-platform and beneficial for Kennesaw State        University, KSU, faculty & staff and students. This app will be crossplatform meaning it can be used on both iOS and Android devices. The main goal behind this app is to create a "master calendar" for the Department of Student Engagement at KSU (this will strictly be a prototype and will not be legally affiliated or maintained by KSU).

##Need To Do-Assigned To:
   ---When we get RSS feed, we parse and get event data: https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/12/use-ngstorage-angularjs-local-storage-needs/
   --Grab data fields to find out which data we are going to use! (Whats given to us? What do we want to use?)
   ---Store event data locally (local database system)
   ---Get clientEvents functionality working correctly.
   -Get popover to display the events.- Farah/Zach (Can display events. Just need to get the day's events)
   --Ordered by time.

   -Calendar height to match screen height. - Kyle (Done/TEST?)
   -Increase size of buttons and font. - Kyle (Done)
   -Functionality to change app's colors (Personality requirement).- Kyle
   --Later saves to device to rememeber!
   -Ignore event press from calendar, goes to the day selected. - Mohini
   ---Remove the drag feature on events.
   -Create the action event "press event" within the popover, display another page with details/options. - Farah
   ---Figure out how to add event to calendar after signing up to volunteer -
