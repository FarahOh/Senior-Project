# Senior-Project
##Group Members: 
Zachery, Kyle, Farah, Mohini 
##Purpose: 
We choose a project in which we will carryout the duration of the semester. 
##Project: 
Basically, we are creating a mobile app, "Student Engagement App," that is cross-platform and beneficial for Kennesaw State        University, KSU, faculty & staff and students. This app will be crossplatform meaning it can be used on both iOS and Android devices. The main goal behind this app is to create a "master calendar" for the Department of Student Engagement at KSU (this will strictly be a prototype and will not be legally affiliated or maintained by KSU). 

##Need To Do:
-When we get RSS feed, we parse and get event data: https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2014/12/use-ngstorage-angularjs-local-storage-needs/
-Store event data locally (local database system)
-Get clientEvents functionality working correctly.
        -Get popover to display the events.
-Month location (Bootstrap)
-Calendar height to match screen height.
-Increase size of buttons
-Functionality to change app's colors (Personality requirement)
-Create functionality of when clicking an event, it goes to the day it is assigned to.
