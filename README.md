# Senior-Project
##Group Members: 
Zachery, Kyle, Farah, Mohini 
##Purpose: 
We choose a project in which we will carryout the duration of the semester. 
##Project: 
Basically, we are creating a mobile app, "Student Engagement App," that is cross-platform and beneficial for Kennesaw State        University, KSU, faculty & staff and students. This app will be crossplatform meaning it can be used on both iOS and Android devices. The main goal behind this app is to create a "master calendar" for the Department of Student Engagement at KSU (this will strictly be a prototype and will not be legally affiliated or maintained by KSU).
